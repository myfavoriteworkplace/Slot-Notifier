📧 Resend Email Integration – Sandbox → Production Guide
(Book-My-Slot Application)
🧩 PHASE 1: What We Wanted to Achieve
Send email notifications for:
Booking confirmation
Booking cancellation
Use a reliable email service
Avoid spam issues
Start without owning a domain
Later migrate to production-grade email
We chose Resend because:
Simple API
Modern DX
Good deliverability
Cloudflare friendly
🧪 PHASE 2: Sandbox Setup (NO DOMAIN REQUIRED)
Sandbox mode is for development & testing.
⚠ Sandbox Rules (Very Important)
Rule	Allowed
Sender email	onboarding@resend.dev
Recipient	Only your Resend account email
Custom domain	❌ Not allowed
Send to customers	❌ Not allowed
✅ STEP 1: Create Resend API Key
Go to https://resend.com
Dashboard → API Keys
Click Create API Key
Fill:
Name: BookMySlot Sandbox
Permission: Send emails (test/sandbox)
Domain: Leave empty
Copy the key
Example:
RESEND_API_KEY=rsk_test_xxxxxxxxx
✅ STEP 2: Configure Environment Variables
In Replit / Render / Backend
RESEND_API_KEY=rsk_test_xxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_FROM=BookMySlot <onboarding@resend.dev>
📌 Why this works:
onboarding@resend.dev is pre-verified by Resend
No DNS needed
✅ STEP 3: Install Resend SDK
npm install resend
✅ STEP 4: Initialize Resend in Backend
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);
✅ STEP 5: Sending Email (Working Example)
await resend.emails.send({
  from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
  to: "itsmyfavoriteworkplace@gmail.com", // YOUR email only
  subject: "Booking Confirmed",
  html: "<h2>Your booking is confirmed</h2>",
});
✅ STEP 6: Add Test Endpoint
Used to verify integration quickly.
app.get("/api/test-email", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await resend.emails.send({
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
      to: req.query.email as string,
      subject: "Backend email test",
      html: "<p>Email system is working!</p>",
    });

    res.json({ success: true });
  } catch (err: any) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: err.message });
  }
});
✅ STEP 7: Testing
Call in browser / Postman:
/api/test-email?email=itsmyfavoriteworkplace@gmail.com
Successful Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "data": {
      "id": "8a5132bf-65ef-4835-920f-a40f49d6f03e"
    }
  }
}
📬 Email received → Sandbox working perfectly
❌ Errors We Saw (And Why)
Error 1: Domain not verified
alerts@book-my-slot.workers.dev
❌ .workers.dev / .pages.dev cannot be verified
Error 2: Can only send to your own email
✔ Correct sandbox behavior
🟢 CURRENT STATUS (Sandbox)
Item	Status
API Key	✅
Backend logic	✅
Email sending	✅
Booking notifications	✅
Production ready	❌ (needs domain)
🚀 PHASE 3: MIGRATING TO PRODUCTION (REAL EMAILS)
To send emails to customers, clinics, any email → you must own a domain.
🔑 STEP 1: Buy a Domain (Cheap & Reliable)
Recommended:
Provider	Cost
Namecheap (.me)	₹200–₹300/year
Porkbun	Low
Google Domains	Paid
Example:
bookmyslot.in
🔑 STEP 2: Add Domain in Resend
Resend → Domains
Add:
bookmyslot.in
🔑 STEP 3: Verify DNS Records
Resend will give:
SPF
DKIM
Return-Path
Add them in:
Cloudflare DNS (recommended)
Wait 5–10 minutes → Verified
🔑 STEP 4: Update EMAIL_FROM
EMAIL_FROM=BookMySlot <alerts@bookmyslot.in>
Restart backend.
🔑 STEP 5: Remove Sandbox Restriction
Now you can send emails to:
Customers
Clinics
Admins
No restrictions.
🧠 BEST PRACTICES (IMPORTANT)
Use transactional email only
Do NOT send marketing from Resend
Use clean HTML
Add unsubscribe only if marketing
🏁 FINAL SUMMARY
Phase	Status
Sandbox setup	✅ Complete
Email delivery test	✅ Passed
Booking emails	✅ Working
